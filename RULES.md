# Agent Rules — Emoji Selector

Rules every change to this app follows. Vocabulary: see [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md).

## Command-Line Arguments

What the exe accepts, parsed in `Program.Main`:

| Argument | Does |
|---|---|
| `--title <text>` (`MainForm.TitleArgument`) | The **second title**: the window reads `Emoji Selector — <text>` |
| Anything else | Ignored |

- `--title` takes the **next argument** as its value, unless that one is an option itself; a value
  missing or blank is ignored (the plain title), it is trimmed, and given twice the last one wins.
- The second title is shown in the **window title bar** — so in the taskbar and Alt+Tab. It is
  **not persisted**.
- It exists for the agents: every launch by Claude Code passes the session's name in it (see
  `CLAUDE.md` § Launch), so instances running side by side tell which implementation they test.

## Repository Docs

The repository's docs — the French versions (`README.fr.md`, `GLOSSARY.fr.md`) kept in step with
the English ones, the language line, one place per fact — follow the rules shared by every
mini-app: `../CLAUDE.md` § Repository Docs.
